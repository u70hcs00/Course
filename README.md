The material is based on ipyparallel document(https://ipyparallel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro.html)

The goal of this material is to provide lecture notes and related Python codes for parallel computing using ipyparallel as well as MPI.  

The lecture notes are Python.pdf and Python2.pdf.  

I also provide a MSWord file (HowtToRunMSMPICode.docx) to demonstrate how to set up a MPI environment uisng MSMPI, which is needed if  
you wish to call MPI library in your Python code.
